# unmute_notifTG
This project is simple. In the Russian Federation, companies use telegrams for corporate communication.
They create chats, sometimes the buzz of notifications can be unbearable during free time.
So I decided to create a mini script to turn off notifications.
Presumably, you need to set the time for which you want to disable the time and the chat for which you want to do.

Before starting you need to log in to https://my.telegram.org/apps
Get the required hash and ID.

When you turn on the script for the first time, you will be asked for a code that will be sent to you by telegram.
After this you will get something like a session. I didn’t see that it had an expiration date, if this is critical for you, then you should find out about it yourself.

This script can be developed in different ways, let’s say I plan to record the chats that I need and turn off notifications for the period of time I need. Plus, you can connect a bot to this script for convenience. I hope this code will be useful to someone.
